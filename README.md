This application is unfinished. Please complete below tasks. Spend max 2 hours.
We would like to have a short written explanation of the changes you made.

1. Move data retrieval methods to separate class / classes (use dependency injection)
2. Favorite / unfavorite tracks. An automatic playlist should be created named "My favorite tracks"
3. The user's playlists should be listed in the left navbar. If a playlist is added (or modified), this should reflect in the left navbar (NavMenu.razor). Preferrably, the left menu should be refreshed without a full page reload.
4. Add tracks to a playlist (existing or new one). The dialog is already created but not yet finished.
5. Search for artist name
